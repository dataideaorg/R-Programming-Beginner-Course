# Contributing Guidelines

Welcome to the R Programming Course development repository! We're excited to have you contribute to this project. To ensure a smooth collaboration, please follow these guidelines when contributing:

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**: Begin by forking the repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Clone Your Fork**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine to start working on your changes.
3. **Create a New Branch**: Create a new branch for each course module or bug fix you work on. This keeps your changes isolated from the main codebase.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-course-module-name
   ```

## Contributing

1. **Work on Specific Sections**: Please make sure to work on only one specific course module at a time.
2. **File Types**: Use the following file types for contributions:
   - **R Markdown (.rmd)**: For interactive documents and course content.
   - **Markdown (.md)**: For documentation and text-based content.
   - **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)**: For interactive coding examples or notebooks.
3. **Follow the Outline**: Adhere to the provided course outline for your section. Make sure your contributions align with the overall structure and objectives.
4. **Formatting**: Make sure code chunks are well-documented. The code should have at least the title, author and date of creation or modification.

## Pull Requests

1. **Open a Pull Request**: When you have completed your work, push your changes to your branch and open a pull request (PR) against the main branch of the repository.
2. **Provide a Description**: In your PR description, include a summary of what youâ€™ve done and any relevant details. Mention if there are any issues or specific areas for review.
3. **Review Process**: Your PR will be reviewed by other team members. Address any feedback or requested changes promptly.
