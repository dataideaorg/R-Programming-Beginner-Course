    "# Flow Control\n",
    " **Flow control** in programming refers to the order in which individual statements, instructions, or function calls are executed within a program. It determines how the program progresses from one instruction to another based on certain conditions and logic.\\\n",
    " Essentially, flow control allows Programmers to guide the program’s execution path.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, programs execute statements sequentially from top to bottom. Each line of code is executed in the order it appears.\\\n",
    "However, there are scenarios where we need more flexibility for example, executing specific blocks of code conditionally or repeatedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before** getting into these statements lets first learn about **Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions\n",
    "- **In programming, a function** is a modular unit of code designed to accomplish a specific task. Think of it as a mini-program within your larger program.\n",
    "- A function encapsulates a set of instructions that perform a well-defined operation.When you call a function, it executes its code and may return a result.\n",
    "- Functions allow you to break down complex programs into smaller, manageable pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Why Are Functions Important?***\n",
    "- Functions help organize your code. Each function handles a specific task, making your program more readable and maintainable.\n",
    "- Once defined, functions can be called multiple times from different parts of your program, reducing redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **R** to define a function we use the keyword Function and assign it to a name which we will use to call the function when we want its functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Function syntax***:\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "my_function <- function(parameters) {\n",
    "  # Function body (code)\n",
