    "# Introduction to R programming \n",

    "\n",
    "**Welcome to this tutorial on the R programming language!** R is a powerhouse for statistical analysis, and the best part? It's open-source, which means it’s completely free—no hidden fees, just pure analytical goodness.\n",
    "\n",
    "R was built with statisticians and data scientists in mind, making it a go-to tool for statistical computing and data analysis. Whether you’re running it on Windows, macOS, or Linux, R’s cross-platform compatibility ensures you can work seamlessly across different environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "But R isn’t just about crunching numbers. It’s also great at handling and processing large datasets, which is why it's often used in machine learning and AI projects. And when it comes to big data, R easily integrates with tools like Hadoop, as well as various databases for data storage and retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of R’s standout features is its ability to create stunning data visualizations. Whether you need high-quality static graphics or interactive visualizations, R has you covered with extensive customization options. And let’s not forget CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network), which boasts over 18,000 packages—an ecosystem so rich, it’s practically like an all-you-can-eat buffet for data analysts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plus, with a strong and active community behind it, you’re never alone when using R. Whether you’re looking for support or just want to share your latest data-driven masterpiece, the R community has your back.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, dive in and start exploring what R can do for you. Just remember: with great power comes great responsibility... and really awesome graphs!"

    "Earlier, I mentioned that R is open-source software, meaning it's free to use—no costs involved. But you might be wondering, \"Where do I actually get it?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "No worries! Just follow along to install R on your machine. Let's get you set up so you can start crunching numbers and creating awesome visualizations in no time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start using R, you need to install the R language itself. This process sets up the R environment on your machine. However, R by itself is just the language and does not include a user interface for writing or managing code. For that, you need an editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to work with R.\n",
    "\n",
    "RStudio is a popular IDE specifically designed for R, offering a comprehensive suite of tools for coding, data analysis, and visualization. While RStudio is the primary environment we'll use in this tutorial, there are alternative editors and IDEs such as VS Code and Jupyter Notebooks that can also work with R. In this tutorial, we will primarily use RStudio but may occasionally use Jupyter Notebooks for specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The R  is freely available for Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) website](\"https://cloud.r-project.org/\") and R studio is available free for download at [Rstudio-desktop](\"https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\")\n",
